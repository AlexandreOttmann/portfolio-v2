# Looking for a New Opportunity: A Year to Grow

My portfolio reflects the fact that I am currently seeking a new full-time position. This follows two and a half years at **Quanted Square**, the agency where I began my career and where I had the chance to learn a wide range of tools, processes, and technologies. I’m deeply grateful for the trust they placed in me and the role they played in shaping the early stages of my professional journey.

Unfortunately, as the company shifted away from its core activity, it was forced to close its operations, leading to an **economic layoff**. I now find myself in a transitional period, with an entire year — starting December 1st, 2025 — to **search for a new role** and **upskill in key emerging domains**.

## A Year Dedicated to Learning and Growth

Given the current state of the tech industry, two fields naturally stood out as priorities for me:

- **Artificial Intelligence**,
- **CyberSecurity**.

With that in mind, I joined **TryHackMe** to follow their cybersecurity learning paths, mostly focused on web security and with a particular interest in **Red Team** challenges.

At the same time, I’m strengthening my skills in **Python**, a language that has become central to the AI ecosystem. This opens several career paths that strongly appeal to me:

- **Data Analyst**
- **Data Scientist**
- **AI Engineer** (with a focus on implementation and integration)

## Balancing Freelance Work, Training, and Job Search

My daily routine is currently split between:

- ongoing **freelance missions**, including continuous work with the travel agency *Odysway*, which regularly requires new features and improvements ;
- my **job applications** and professional outreach ;
- active **tech monitoring** and the training programs I’m following.

## A Chance to Grow and Reset

If I don’t secure a position immediately, this year will offer me the time and space to continue improving, expand my skills, and reflect on the long-term direction I want to take. It’s a constructive pause — an opportunity to step back, refocus, and re-craft my professional identity.

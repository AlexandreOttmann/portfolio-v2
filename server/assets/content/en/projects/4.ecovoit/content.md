# Ecovoit — Final Project (Wild Code School)

**Ecovoit** is the final project I completed during my time at the **Wild Code School** — a fully featured carpooling application inspired by the familiar Blablacar experience. Over a period of three months, I worked within a four-developer team, adopting a structured, professional workflow from initial concept to a production-ready application.

### 🧩 Design & Architecture

We began with an extensive design and planning phase:

- prototyping and UI design using **Figma**,
- wireframes and design system creation,
- modeling with **MERISE** (class diagrams, conceptual & logical data models),
- sequence diagrams, use cases, user flows,
- definition of system architecture and technical foundations.

This upfront work ensured solid specifications and a well-structured product vision.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack & Tools

We chose a modern and ambitious tech stack:

- **Frontend:** **React**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, **Material UI**
- **Backend:** **GraphQL**, **Node.js**, **TypeORM**, **PostgreSQL**, **OAuth**
- **Infrastructure & Tools:** **Docker**, containerized environments
- **Payments & External Services:** **Stripe** for transactions, **Nodemailer** for email delivery
- **Testing:** **Jest** (unit tests), **Cypress** (end-to-end tests)

This stack enabled us to build a reliable, scalable, and modern application aligned with industry standards.

### 🚀 Development & Delivery

Implementing this project was a real challenge on multiple fronts:

- team coordination, agile workflow, Git workflow,
- building a secure, type-safe GraphQL backend,
- integrating payments, OAuth authentication, and email notifications,
- developing a responsive, high-performance frontend,
- setting up a full testing pipeline (unit + E2E).

In the end, we delivered a complete and polished application with a technical depth far beyond what is typically expected from an end-of-studies project. **Ecovoit stands as a strong demonstration of our ability to design, architect, and develop a full-stack product from scratch.**

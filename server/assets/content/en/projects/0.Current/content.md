## Looking for New Opportunities

I am currently seeking a new **full-time position** and using this transition period to strengthen and expand my technical skill set. I am actively training in **Cyber Security** (via TryHackMe) and improving my **Python** proficiency to prepare for opportunities in **Data Science** and further broaden my technical capabilities.

In parallel, I continue to work on several **freelance projects**, including ongoing collaborations with the travel agency **Odysway**, with whom I’ve been working for over two years.

My goal is to quickly join a company where I can **thrive**, contribute to meaningful projects, and keep growing professionally.

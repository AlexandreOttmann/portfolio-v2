## Odysway — Full-Stack Developer & Technical Consultant

Odysway was the very first professional project I worked on after completing my studies. Over the last two years, I have contributed to their platform alongside other missions, and I continue to collaborate with them today as a **freelance developer**. This project has been a true **technical sandbox**, giving me the opportunity to experiment, build, refactor, and deploy a wide range of tools and solutions.

Here is a non-exhaustive overview of my work on the Odysway travel agency platform:

### 🔧 Architecture & Technical Migrations

- **Complete refactor of the codebase** and multiple migrations: **Nuxt 2 → Nuxt 3 → Nuxt 4**.
- **Replacement of a custom back-office** with a full CRM solution (**ActiveCampaign**), including data migration and automation setup.
- **CMS migrations**: ButterCMS → Nuxt Studio → Sanity.
- **Firebase → Supabase** migration (authentication, database, storage).

### 💳 Payments, Funnels & User Experience

- Full redesign of **conversion funnels** and improvement of end-to-end user journeys.
- Implementation of advanced payment workflows: **Stripe**, **Alma**, installment payments, **bank transfer** support.
- Complete visual redesign of the application, including brand identity and UI, aligned with the Nuxt 2 → 3 transition.

### 📊 Data & Tracking

- Deployment of **Data Visualization** tools using Supabase + **Trevor**.
- Integration of tracking and analytics systems: **Meta Pixel**, **Hotjar**, **Google Tag (gtag)**, custom event tracking.

### ⚙️ Performance, SEO & Business Features

- Deep optimization of **SEO**, accessibility, and runtime performance.
- Development of a **custom travel booking system** tailored to Odysway’s business processes.

# Quanted Square — Full-Stack Developer & Analyst (2023–2025)

I joined **Quanted Square** in 2023 as part of a one-year apprenticeship with the **Wild Code School**, marking the beginning of my first experience as a full-stack developer. After completing the program, I continued working with the company until December 2025, becoming its **first full-time employee**.

This experience played a decisive role in my growth. I was given significant autonomy as well as the trust and mentorship of **Fabien** and **Julien**, which allowed me to progress quickly, develop critical thinking, and make informed technical decisions.

Over these two and a half years, I worked on a wide range of projects and technical challenges. Some of the most notable missions include:

### ⚙️ Application Development & Redesign

- **Full redesign of a web application (Odysway)**: modernizing the architecture, improving performance, and enhancing the user experience.
- **Technology migrations**: switching CMS platforms and backend tools (Nuxt Studio, ButterCMS, Sanity), rebuilding payment and CRM ecosystems (Stripe, ActiveCampaign, Alma, etc.).

### 💳 Business-Critical Integrations

- Implementation of **advanced payment solutions**: Stripe (Checkout, PaymentIntents, SEPA), bank transfers, Alma, and more.
- Setup of authentication architectures using **OAuth**, tokens, and security best practices.
- Integration and orchestration of **multiple APIs, webhooks, and third-party services**.

### 📊 Data & Product Engineering

- **Data visualization** and data manipulation using **D3.js**, creation of interactive dashboards.
- Structuring and processing complex datasets for internal products and client-facing tools.

### 🔎 Technical Audits & Advisory

- **Technical audits** for investment funds, notably **Educapital**: architecture analysis, codebase review, interviews with CTOs and engineering teams, and strategic reporting.

### 🏭 Product Development — Crown

- Design and development of **Crown**, a real-time auction application for industrial clients. Stack: **Nuxt**, **Vuetify**, **Supabase** (auth, live queries, real-time features, storage).

This experience significantly shaped my professional development: it taught me to **learn fast**, **prototype efficiently**, make **well-reasoned technical decisions**, and operate across the full stack—from frontend to backend, including product and data challenges.

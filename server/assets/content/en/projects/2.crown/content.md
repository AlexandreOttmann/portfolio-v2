# Crown — Real-Time eAuction Platform for Industrial Procurement

**Crown** is one of the flagship products developed at **Quanted Square**. We built a full-featured online auction platform tailored for industrial procurement teams — a high-performance **real-time eAuction** solution designed for professional buyers and large-scale negotiations.

The primary goal was to deliver a **premium**, reliable, and intuitive tool capable of running complex live auctions with zero friction and millisecond-level reactivity. By leveraging **Nuxt**, **Vuetify**, and **Supabase Realtime**, we engineered a platform that meets these expectations while offering a polished interface perfectly aligned with client needs and procurement workflows.

### 🧩 Features & Architecture

- Real-time auction engine powered by **Supabase Realtime**, ensuring instant synchronization for all bidding participants.
- Frontend developed with **Nuxt + Vuetify**, delivering a smooth and professional user experience.
- Advanced dashboards and data visualizations built using **D3.js** (price evolution, bidder activity, live insights).
- A complete admin panel: user management, auction creation, session controls, configurations, role and permission systems.
- Implementation of sophisticated business logic: dynamic durations, automatic extensions, floor prices, bidding rules, and more.

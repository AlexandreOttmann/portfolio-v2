## Portfolio V1

This project marks my very first online portfolio, showcasing a selection of study projects, technical experiments, and a few articles about my background. Designed as a true learning playground, it gave me the opportunity to explore and strengthen my skills with modern front-end technologies such as **React**, **ChakraUI**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Framer Motion**.

More than just a simple showcase, this portfolio allowed me to experiment with interface animation, reusable component architecture, responsive design, and performance optimization. It was a foundational step in my transition into web development — a project where I could express my creativity while adopting industry-standard best practices.

## Koober — Audio Lead & Content Production Manager (3 years)

**Koober** was the first startup I worked for, following a six-month internship that evolved into a three-year professional experience. The company builds a **React Native** mobile app offering condensed audio versions of non-fiction books. Within Koober, I led the **Audio Production Department**, with responsibilities spanning **team management**, **content creation**, and **production workflow supervision**.

- Maintained audio quality standards and managed the full production pipeline.
- **Studio recording**, editing, mixing, and final mastering of audio content.
- Production of visual assets and motion content for the platform and marketing.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technical Expertise

My main tools included:

- **Pro Tools**, **Logic Pro** — recording, editing, mixing, and sound processing.
- **After Effects** — visual and motion content creation.
- Internal **back-office management** for content organization and validation.
- Implementation and optimization of **Lean methodology** across production processes, improving efficiency and reducing operational bottlenecks.

### 🧩 Skill Development

During this experience, I developed strong competencies in:

- **project management** and team coordination,
- **product thinking**, through close collaboration with tech and design teams,
- client and partner relationship management,

Before transitioning to software engineering, Koober was a formative experience that strengthened my ability to manage teams, streamline processes, and deliver high-quality content consistently.

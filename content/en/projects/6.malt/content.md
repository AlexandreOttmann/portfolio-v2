## My Background as a Sound Engineer

Before transitioning into software development, I spent several years working as a **sound engineer**, while also carrying out a wide range of **freelance projects**. Over the years, I completed close to a hundred missions — a selection of which can be found on my **Malt profile**.

My work spanned a variety of audio production fields:

- podcast editing, cleanup, and **audio correction**,
- sound design and custom sonic creation,
- production of **audiobooks**, albums, commercials, short films, and YouTube videos,
- full soundscape creation for narrative and immersive projects.

### 🎧 Notable Achievements

Among the projects I’m most proud of:

- A one-hour **sound creation** dedicated to Molière, produced with actors from the *Comédie-Française*, for **Molière, le fou de théâtre**. I crafted the entire sound universe: atmospheres, effects, editing, and mixing.
- Recording, directing, and post-producing the children’s audiobook **Les aventures de Gurty** with actress **Audrey Lamy**, published on Audible.

This experience allowed me to develop strong skills in client management, technical precision, artistic direction, and narrative audio craftsmanship.

### 🌐 My Sound Design Portfolio

Before building web applications, I had already created my very first website: a portfolio showcasing my audio work.

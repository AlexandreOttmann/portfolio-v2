# 🇯🇵 **A Summer in Japan — Four Weeks of Gentle Heat and Light**

Some trips are planned for months. And then there are those decided almost on a breath — just after finishing a training program, right before starting a new professional adventure. Mine was born like that: a ticket bought without thinking, a light suitcase, a Fuji x100v hanging from my neck… and four weeks ahead of me to just drift along.

This is the story of a summer month in Japan — between festivals, steaming sentō, hidden cafés, misty mountains, and cities that never sleep.

With my first web developer diploma validated in May 2023, an apprenticeship signed at the same time, prompted by my parents and with four months ahead of me before my next professional chapter, I booked my flight tickets to Japan a month later, for the end of July.

# **TOKYO — July 27 to August 10**

### *Neon lights, festivals, and my first hot baths*

Tokyo was my entry point — a luminous chaos you slowly learn to navigate. Kuramae, Asakusa, Ginza, Harajuku, Ikebukuro… the city swallowed me whole and spat me back into atmospheres that never felt the same twice.

I witnessed the **Sumidagawa Fireworks Festival** — a sky where colors drifted with the heat. I danced — clumsily but sincerely — at the **Ebisu Bon Odori**, turning around the glowing tower at the center, carried by the music.

I tasted my first real sushi in Tsukiji, ate a melting omurice while searching for shade, wandered retro streets in Shibamata, and roamed through temples quieter than you would imagine. I spent hours in cafés and discovered **sentō**, those public baths where fatigue dissolves in hot water.

Tokyo is organized chaos… but also a softness you wouldn’t expect.

Osaka is a permanent firework. Kuromon Ichiba with its stalls and sizzling skewers; the peaceful, stone-paved alleys of Hozenji Yokocho; and Shinsekai — bright, retro, alive.

# **HAKONE — August 5**

### *Mist, volcanoes, and my first deep onsen*

Hakone felt like a breath of air after Tokyo’s density. Between the open-air museum sculptures, the Owakudani fumes, and the Ropeway suspended above the valley… everything seemed to belong to another world.

It’s there that I understood the power of **onsen**: the body sheds its weight, the mind opens, the light comes back. A quiet, essential ceremony.

# **ENOSHIMA — August 6**

### *Salted wind and a summer break*

A day with my feet in the sand, the sound of waves, towels spread randomly on the shore. Nothing spectacular — just the perfect place to breathe.

# **TOKYO, again — August 7 to 10**

### *teamLab, cafés, and a final urban whirlwind*

Back in Tokyo, I was absorbed by the water-and-light rooms of **teamLab Planets**, an almost meditative experience.

I saw the giant Gundam again, walked through Ginza, had coffee in Shibuya, ate sushi that melted like memories… before leaving the capital behind.

# **KYOTO — August 10 to 16**

### *Red torii, ancient alleys, and mountains on fire*

Kyoto was a turning point. The city breathes more slowly, with elegance and depth.

I climbed the red torii of Fushimi Inari at dawn, drank cold tea by the Kamo River, walked the alleys of Gion and Pontocho where time seems to hold its breath. I strolled along the Philosopher’s Path, climbed Mount Daimonji, and wandered between the Golden and Silver Pavilions.

Kyoto was also where I experienced something powerful: **Daimonji**, the giant kanji lit on the mountains. A ritual that is intense, solemn, almost hypnotic.

And then came one of my favorites of the whole trip: **Funaoka Onsen**. An old wooden sentō, a scalding hot bath, an atmosphere so authentic it goes straight through you. I felt something like a return to myself there.

# **ŌTSU — August 17**

### *The lake, Mount Hiei, and a suspended day*

By the shores of Lake Biwa, everything feels calmer. Mount Hiei, wrapped in mist, offered temples floating between sky and earth. A gentle, almost silent transition before Osaka’s energy.

# **OSAKA — August 18 → 21**

### *Food, neon lights, and human warmth*

A hike to the Minoh waterfalls, a street-food tour that fed me for a week, buzzing neon signs… Osaka is joyful, direct, generous.

# **NARA — August 20**

### *Deer and distant silence*

The deer bow their heads for a biscuit, then look at me as if I were the day’s guest. Venturing deeper into the park, I found an almost absolute calm — hills bathed in light. A gentle parenthesis.

# **BACK TO TOKYO — August 21 → 24**

### *Last moments, last baths, last glances*

One last curry, one last neighborhood, one last glass of iced water from a kombini. I look at the city one last time from Roppongi, then from Haneda’s platform. The heat is still there — but I already know I’ll miss it.

# ✨ **What Japan Left Me**

Scalding baths that erase exhaustion. The sound of summer festivals. Lanterns dancing above the alleys. The taste of warm rice. The soft wind brushing the red torii. The silence of temples. The neon lights, the mountains, the deer, the sea.

And above all: the desire to return. Because a month isn’t enough. Because a summer there marks you for a long time.

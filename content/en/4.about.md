A few words about me

#intro
Fullstack developer based in Paris, France. Passionate about the web, AI, and modern technologies, I love designing high-performance and elegant digital experiences where design meets code logic. With several years of experience across agencies, startups, and freelance projects, I've contributed to creating custom applications, interactive platforms, and real-time data-driven tools. My career transition was a real turning point, blending passion with professionalization.

Curious and demanding, I enjoy continuous learning and exploring new approaches — whether it's perfecting my skills in the JavaScript ecosystem (Nuxt, GraphQL, TypeScript...), training in new technologies (Python, CyberSecurity...), or working on personal projects that blend design, technology, and innovation.
